# AutoAstroFitsReduction
Automating .fits astronomical image reduction

I am trying to make a program that rerduces astron√≥mical .fits images automaticaly. First I am learning to use API's and then I will try image alignement with the astrometry.net API. Lastly I will upload the stacking and subtracting of images, which I did with the python ccdproc library. Any help is welcome.
