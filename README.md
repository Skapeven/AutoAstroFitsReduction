# AutoAstroFitsReduction
Automating .fits astronomical image reduction

I am trying to make a program that reduces astronomical .fits images automaticaly. First I am learning to use API's and then I will try image alignment with the astrometry.net API. Lastly I will upload the stacking and subtracting of images, which I did with the python ccdproc library. Any help is welcome. 

Please only contribute using python.
Otherwise upload your other language software to a "name of the language" branch.
