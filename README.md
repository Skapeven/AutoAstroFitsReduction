# AutoAstroFitsReduction
Automating .fits astronomical image reduction

I am trying to make a program that reduces astronomical .fits images automaticaly. First I am learning to use API's and then I will try image alignment with the astrometry.net API. Then I will upload the stacking and subtracting of images, which I did with the python ccdproc library or maybe use also atrometry.net for this processes. And finally I will automate te entire process of using these three functions to make the master bias, master dark, master flat, light corrections, alignment and color stacking plus some basic color calibration to any folder with the correct structure you run the script on. Any help is welcome.
